Building a Squishy Application:
The Meta Tutorial

Chapter 1: Starting an Application
-->

<!--
The most basic Squishy UI application starts with index.html.
The UI in a browser is rendered to the screen using a program interface called the DOM.
The DOM provides a set of controls for on-screen display - image, text, boxes, flow, styling -
in the form of an API for changes and persistent state.


HTML is a way to define bits of static DOM structure in text.  Likewise, CSS is a way to define
static styling data in text.  Both are "scripts" executed by the browser's DOM to build a DOM state.

However, neither of these are programming languages, but formats of static data.  So they don't provide
a way to define interaction, timing, or anything dynamic like requesting external data.

Squishy uses Javascript to provide a programmatic interface to the DOM.  So the entirety of the definition
of an application can live entirely within javascript code.

The only thing required is an entry point into the browser for the javascript.  This app index page is
that entry point.

-->
<html>
    <head>
<!--

All applications start by loading the base squishy module as the first script in the page.

Note: some web servers will automatically redirect js/lib/squishy to js/lib/squishy/index.js if it is available.

-->
        <script src="js/lib/squishy/index.js"></script>
        <!--

From this point on, this module "squishy" defined in that file will be available using

    Import("squishy",function(squishy) {

    });

in JS code.  The base directory /js/lib/squishy will be referred to as the relative folder name "squishy"
in import statements: "squishy/DOM, squishy/interactive, etc." This will happen with any module index file.

You can browse through the code found in squishy as a reference while building applications.  It contains
documented function definitions.  Treat this file and its submodules as the Appendix to this tutorial series.

This area could also include static links to other sources, styling, or meta data for the page.

-->
    </head>
    <body>
<!--

For search engine optimization, you should put information in this file that you want spiders to read.
But all of the interactive UI will be generated by the javascript.

-->

    </body>

<!--

Finally, your application script will be run after the body tag.  You could also put the entire Squishy application
here but the preferred practice is to use separate files for modularity and ease of editing.
